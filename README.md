🔐 Project Title: Password Generator using React
📝 Project Description
This project is a responsive password generator web application built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components. It enables users to generate random, strong passwords with customizable options like:

➡ Desired password length
➡ Inclusion of numbers
➡ Inclusion of special characters

The app provides real-time generation and allows users to copy the password to the clipboard with visual feedback using a "Copied✔" state.

🔍 Features Implemented
➡ Feature	➡ Description
➡ Password Length Slider	Users can select password length (6 to 100 characters).
➡ Toggle Include Numbers	Option to include numbers (0-9) in the password.
➡ Toggle Include Special Characters	Option to include special symbols (!@#$%&*) in the password.
➡ Real-Time Password Generation	Password auto-updates based on options selected.
➡ Clipboard Copy Functionality	Copy button copies the password and shows a "Copied✔" message.
➡ Reusable UI Components	Used modular ShadCN components like Card, Button, and Input for UI building.

🧠 What You Learned
🔧 1. React Core Concepts
➡ useState for managing dynamic states like password, length, and toggles.
➡ useEffect to auto-generate a password whenever any option changes.
➡ useCallback to optimize and memoize the password generation function.

🧰 2. Component-Based UI with ShadCN
➡ Used ShadCN components like Card, Button, and Input for modular design.
➡ Achieved responsive and professional UI using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

🔁 3. Event Handling
➡ Handled slider value change to update password length.
➡ Toggled checkbox state for including numbers and characters.
➡ Enabled "Copy" button interaction with clipboard and state feedback.
➡ Understood the use of controlled and uncontrolled components in React.

📋 4. Clipboard API
➡ Implemented navigator.clipboard.writeText() to copy the generated password.
➡ Showed "Copied✔" confirmation with a 2-second timeout using setTimeout.

🔐 5. Password Logic
➡ Designed a flexible and extendable password logic using conditional string concatenation.
➡ Applied Math.random() to generate characters based on selected constraints.

💾 6. Git & GitHub
➡ Initialized a Git repository from scratch using git init.
➡ Committed code using git add . and git commit.
➡ Handled remote conflicts and configured correct origin URL.
➡ Pushed project to GitHub with branch renaming using git branch -M main.

⚙️ 7. Project Structure & Clean Code
➡ Followed clean folder structure (e.g., src/components/ui).
➡ Wrote maintainable and readable JSX.
➡ Used best practices for checkboxes (defaultChecked and state control).
➡ Kept utility functions (generatePassword) separate from rendering logic.

📦 Project Stack
➡ Tool	➡ Purpose
➡ React	Core frontend framework
➡ Vite	Lightning-fast dev server and bundler
➡ Tailwind CSS	Utility-first responsive CSS framework
➡ ShadCN/UI	Component library built on Radix and Tailwind
➡ Git	Version control for source management
➡ GitHub	Remote repository hosting and collaboration tool

🛠️ Potential Improvements
➡ Add a password strength meter (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong).
➡ Implement password history so users can view previous passwords.
➡ Add dark mode toggle using Tailwind's dark: class support.
➡ Make layout fully mobile-friendly with adaptive sizing.
➡ Add unit tests with libraries like Jest or React Testing Library for validation.
